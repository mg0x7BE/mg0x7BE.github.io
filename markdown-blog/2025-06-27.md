# Screenshots in macOS

Some of the most important shortcuts I discovered in macOS are the keyboard shortcuts for taking screenshots.

It's worth remembering the following:

**Full screen:**

- Cmd + Shift + 3 → saves to desktop

- Cmd + Shift + Control + 3 → to clipboard

**Screen selection:**

- Cmd + Shift + 4 → saves to desktop

- Cmd + Shift + Control + 4 → to clipboard

**Specific window:**

- Cmd + Shift + 4, then Space → saves to desktop

- Cmd + Shift + Control + 4, then Space → to clipboard
