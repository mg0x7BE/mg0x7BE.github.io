# RTO: A function that transforms companies

```
Input: Company with remote workers
Apply: RTO mandate
Output: ???

Step 1: Filter top talent
|> Best employees (with options) → exit()
|> Result: Reduced talent pool

Step 2: Transform morale  
|> Remaining employees → unhappy
|> Result: Lower engagement

Step 3: Return value
|> Signal to employees: "Your preferences don't matter"
|> Type: CompanyPriorities<RealEstate, Control>

```

**Edge case**: Some roles genuinely benefit from office (hardware labs, physical collaboration). But blanket RTO for all roles? That's applying the wrong function to the wrong data type.
