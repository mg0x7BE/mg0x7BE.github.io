# If your app > 100KB, delete your GitHub

There exists a fundamental truth whose denial disqualifies you as an engineer: **code size is inversely proportional to programmer competence**.

If your application needs more than 100KB, you simply cannot program. End of discussion.

Super Mario Land: 64KB. The entire game. Your Electron TODO list: 300MB. See the problem? No? That's why you ARE the problem.

**Kubernetes is an admission you can't run three processes**. Real programmers write a 10-line systemd config. You need 47 YAMLs, and a dedicated SRE team because you don't understand how Linux works. This isn't "cloud native" - it's crutches for the crippled.

**JavaScript on the backend isn't a "technology choice"**. It's blasphemy against the very concept of computation. Node.js isn't a server - it's an ecological disaster consuming RAM and generating heat for no reason.

The truth is brutal: **if your text editor needs more memory than a 1995 operating system, you're not a programmer**. You're a framework consumer. The difference is like a chef versus someone who only microwaves ready meals.

**VS Code is just Chrome** (that learned to open .txt files and now thinks it's a professional tool). 4GB RAM to edit JSON? Every milligram of that resource screams: "my user can't use vim".

**C, C++, Rust, Zig. These are the only real languages**. The rest are toys for people afraid of pointers and manual memory management. And they're right to be afraid - because they don't understand how computers work at a fundamental level. Don't even get me started on Python (designed for the SOLE PURPOSE of making data scientists FEEL included).

**The size of node_modules is the measurement of your ignorance**. 500MB of dependencies for a "Hello World" project? Congratulations, you just proved you can't write even basic functions.

Real engineers write programs that start instantly. A splash screen is an apology for poor architecture. A progress bar is a confession: "I don't know how to optimize this code".

Apollo 11 flew to the Moon with 64KB of memory. Your pizza ordering app needs 8GB. Civilization isn't advancing - it's degenerating at an embarrassingly fast pace.
This isn't an opinion. This is a technical fact you refuse to accept because the truth hurts.
